# NAME

`App::GymScheduler` â€” Randomized schedule maker for your workouts


```perl6
    $ gym.p6
```

# DESCRIPTION

This program creates a random schedule for your workouts. It lets you have N
workout days each month, but it randomizes when the workout days occur,
so you don't feel like you're in a rut.

The program ensures the workouts don't happen on the weekend and
supports workout "modes" that it loops through one after another. These rules
are currently hard-coded, but if there's interest to make these customizeable
I can take a PR.

# EXECUTABLES

This distribution installs `gym.p6` program. On its first execution will create
`.gym.p6.conf` file in your home directory. Edit that file to customize
your scheduler, if necessary. Running the program prints a calendar with
your work out days marked off.

# LIMITATIONS

Requires
[`Terminal::ANSIColor`](https://modules.perl6.org/repo/Terminal::ANSIColor),
which probably doesn't work on Windows's `cmd.exe`.
